These are my [Advent of Code][aoc] (AoC) puzzle solutions.

Most recent solutions use [Typescript][ts]. I don't aim to be first on any leaderboard, I just want to learn to solve some of these problems and having some fun while doing it. Sharing my solutions for anyone interested

## Running locally

Each file on the corresponding year directory, exports a solution to a problem. To debug a solution, you can edit the index.ts file, import a solution and `console.log()` it to display it.

```bash
pnpm dev
```
